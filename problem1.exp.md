Explanation: 

Solution to this problem was pretty simple, had to apply binary search through (2,N) as the square root of any number in the world lies in that range. 

Time Complexity:
Since the binary search algorithm is involved, worst case time complexity is O(logn) 

Space Complexity:
The algorithm by itself doesn't require any auxillary space to operate except for a few variables, therefore the space complexity is 
O(1)
