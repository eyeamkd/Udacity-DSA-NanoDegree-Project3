# Idea 

I kinda hacked around the solution for this problem, I sorted the array using the quick sort algorithm that I learnt in this section which runs in the time complexity of O(nlogn) 
and then constructed two numbers using the elements alternatively from the sorted array 

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) + O(n) ~= O(nlogn) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
